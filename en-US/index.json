In Absence Register list a check mark Recasted appears for this entry. As a result of the recalculation, the system creates a entry in Component Register for the current period (08.2020) with the previous month's salary correction records. 3) at the end of the period, calculate the salary for the current month. The income calculation will be included the previous month's adjustments. Several sick leaves received late Example: calculated and paid salary for 07.2020.

Jālejuplādē šī instalācija un jāinstalē uz lokālā datora. wkhtmltox-0.12.5-1.msvc2015-win64.exe Instalēt var pēc noklusējuma folderī: C:\\Program Files\\wkhtmltopdf VS Code Latvian-Payroll-Help projektam jāuztaisa sinhronizācija ar Azure. Windows Explorer jāatver folderis, kurā atrodas Latvian-Payroll-Help projekts, tajā pēc sinhronizācijas parādīsies folderis en-US\\PDF un faili: generate_PDF_user_scenarious.cmd docfx-pdf-user_scenarious.json generate_pdfs_user_scenarious.ps1 Palaižot failu generate_PDF_user_scenarious.cmd ģenerēsies PDF dokumenti folderī _site_pdf LV analoģiski. .. Latvian-Payroll-Help\\lv-LV\\generate_PDF_user_scenarious.cmd Tagad fails generate_pdfs_user_scenarious.ps1 noskaņots atbilstoši tekošai situācijai. Būtu korektāk, ja EN un LV folderu struktūra būtu vienāda. Ja folderu struktūra un failu usage_scenarios.md vieta tiek mainīta, failā generate_pdfs_user_scenarious.ps1 atbilstoši jāmaina ceļš, lai PDF faili ģenerētos, vai jāpadod ziņa, ka veiktas izmaiņas. Vai arī jāatrod PDF faili bez ELVA Logo un manuāli jāapvieno ar PDF failu ar ELVA Logo, ja ir tāda nepieciešamība. Bez ELVA Logo PDF failiem jāģenerējas jebkurā gadījumā. Latvian Payroll APP esošā struktūra https://viewer.diagrams.net/?highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&page-id=sh0kiihFA3qfodnlnWjH&title=PayrollExtension.drawio#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fuc%3Fid%3D1XqGc79bLRaoQO2oare4AAuQkOHe5IhWE%26export%3Ddownload Nākotnē, iespējams, HR Portal Integration APP tiks iekļauts Parsonnel Advanced, pagaidām tas APP nav vēl uzrakstīts. Ideālā gadījumā APP Help struktūrai vajadzētu būt analoģiskai APP struktūrai. EDS Import būtu jābūt zem Payroll Advanced, nevis atsevišķi izdalītam. Agrāk bija vīzija, ka EDS Import būs atsevišķs modulis, tagad ir vīzija, ka nebūs."
